This Python script scrapes news titles from a website.

How to use:

Replace 'URL HERE' with the URL of the news website you want to scrape. Make sure the website you choose has news articles listed on a single page that the script can access.
Run the script. The script will attempt to retrieve the webpage content and then parse it to find elements with a specific class (assuming all articles share the same class). It will then extract and print the titles of those elements.
Requirements:

requests library: This library is used to make HTTP requests to the website. You can install it using pip install requests.
BeautifulSoup library: This library is used to parse the HTML content of the webpage. You can install it using pip install beautifulsoup4.
Note:

This script is a basic example and might need adjustments depending on the structure of the website you are targeting. You might need to modify the class name used to identify the news articles.
Be mindful of the website's terms and conditions when scraping data.
